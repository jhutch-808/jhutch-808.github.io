							<p>
								As a member of the executive board for All Students Interested in Asia (A.S.I.A.), the largest multicultural organization at Rhodes College, <br>
								I've had the privilege of not only representing my cultural heritage but also fostering an environment where others can share theirs. A.S.I.A.<br>
								is dedicated to bringing cultural awareness to our community and providing a platform where identity can be celebrated and understood. <br>
								We host three major events annually, alongside several smaller ones, inviting the entire campus to engage in our shared experience.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through our events, we've drawn over 300 attendees, showcased various community performances, and offered a taste of our cultural cuisine. <br>
								Beyond these numbers, though, lies the heart of our work: creating a safe, welcoming space where everyone feels valued and heard.<br>
								Being a part of A.S.I.A. has allowed me to grow as a leader, working collaboratively to ensure that our community is more inclusive and culturally aware. <br>
								In turn, I've seen the organization flourish, becoming a cornerstone of cultural expression and understanding at Rhodes College.
